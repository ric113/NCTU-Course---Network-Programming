### Project 1 .
  A simple remote Shell system , 
  see "hw1.txt" to know the function ,
  see "hw1_spec.txt" to know how to start it .
  Use client.c(by tutor) to test the server .

  * Part 1 : A simple CGI program for connecting to Project1/2 Server (in C/C++) .

  * Part 3 : HTTP Server + CGI(same as Part1) using Winsock (in Visual Studio).

See "hw3_spec.txt" and "notes.txt" to know how to use them ,
